# UbuntuInstalliationwithPython

Hello Everyone! My name is Tashvin Jayanth and I am from grade 5A1
Today I programmed ubuntu installiation process, it is like a 
prototype of ubunut installiation screen or process.
So in the statring of the project, there will be some conversastion
of god and the programmer which is me. If you don't like it
you can just delete the code which is under this comment."Conversation
of god and the programmer who developed it.", If you delete
this lines, the converstaion no longer will be printed or runned
in the terminal or the app which you are using to run or write the 
code.I just wrote lines for the converstaion becuase, Every project
starts directly, So why can't we add a conversation in start of the 
programm for fun, so thats why i added this converstation in the 
start of the program. You haft to try to understand the code to know
how is this program working. By understatind the program, you will
learn this concepts. While loops, if and else statments, time module 
and the getpass module. If you don't know this concepts, you can watch
and learn with youtube, but I will give the introduction of time and getpass
module,

# Time
Time module is used to stop the program in the middle, after some 
seconds the program continues. You can import the time module with this 
line of code.
import time
The time moudle is not only used for stopping the program in the middle
of the programm for few seconds, it is used for many other things.

# Getpass
Getpass moudle is used the hide text which user types in for the input.
When the user types in some text, the text will not appear in the console,
terminal or command prompt, which ever you are using, the text the user
types will not appear. But it stores in the text you are typing in a 
variable.
